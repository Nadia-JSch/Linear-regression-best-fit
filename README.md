# Linear-regression-best-fit

Plots the line of best fit to data showing the progression of diabetes (Y-axis) given BMI. The aim is to understand how linear regression is used in supervised machine learning.

## Description

Uses the Diabetes data set from Sklearn to find the line of best fit using y = mx + b. Values of y are predicted given m and b that are trained on the given labelled data. Data consists of BMI values (standardised to a 0 mean) and the x-axis and diabetes disease progression (after one-year baseline)

### Dependencies

The following libraries are imported:
* matplotlib (for plotting the scatter plot)
* numpy (for arrays and maths functions)
* sklearn (for the data set)
